AnalogClock v2.0 beta
=====================

The AnalogClock is a .net control that displays a time as an old style analog clock.


The code design - Quick look
----------------------------

In short words:
- The action is performed by a timer.
- The data is provided by an ITimeProvider.
- The appearance is controlled with IShape objects.


The action - System.Windows.Forms.Timer object
----------------------------------------------

The AnalogClock's value can be set in two ways:
1) manually by specifying the TimeSpan value to be displayed. The value is static and it will not be changed until you specify a new one;
2) automatically by a System.Windows.Forms.Timer object that updates the displayed value periodically. The timer is using the TimeSpan value obtained from the ITimeProvider object.


The data - ITimeProvider interface
----------------------------------

The sole purpose of the ITimeProvider interface is to provide a TimeSpan object when someone requests it.
AnanlogClock comes with three implementations of the ITimeProvider interface:
	- LocalTimeProvider - Returns the system's local time.
	- UtcTimeProvider - Returns the UTC time.
	- UtcOffsetTimeProvider - Returns the UTC time to which an offset is added.


The appearance - IShape interface
---------------------------------

When it comes to the visual part, the clock is highly customizable. The hands, the numbers, the ticks that mark the seconds on the side of the clock, all are drawn by IShape objects and not directly by the clock. Therefore you can replace the default ISahpe instances that handle the respecitive visual elements with some custom implementations that draws them as you need. For example you can replace the hands that, by default, are vectorial shapes, with some images. This is done with an ImageHand object (that also implements IShape interface). A demo project can be found in the release package.


Design Time Support
-------------------

All the shapes's properties and the time provider's properties have design time support. But the shapes and the time provider themselves can not be replaced from the design. This will be implemented in a future version. For now, the only way to replace the shapes and the time provider is from the code.


Thr Skin
--------

As I already said, you have two methods to change the way the clock looks:
1) Change the parameters of the shapes that the clock uses by default.
2) Replace one or all of the shapes with custom ones.

A skin is a collection of IShape objects that can be applied all at once. The same efect you can obtain by setting the shapes one by one.


Developing a new shape
----------------------

The shapes are drawn for a clock with diameter of 100px. The clock will scale them as needed.

To create a new shape you need to do the folowing steps:
1) Create a new class that either implements the IShape interface or it extends one of the already existing base classes. For example ShapeBase or VectorialShapeBase.
2) Overwrite the Name property. This is not so important, but is nice to have a desriptive name for the shape.
3) Overwrite the Draw method. This is the method that actually draws the shape on the control. You can imagine this one is pretty important. ;)

Obs: You may want to overwrite the Dispose method, too, to clean the memory of the tools used in the drawing process.


Features
--------

- Customizable appearance. (Using IShape objects.)
- Decoupled design. The actor (that updates the control), tha data (that is displayed) and the view (the way the clock looks) are decoupled.
- Scalable.
- Easy to use.
