		<h1>Change Log</h1>

		<h2>ver 2.0 beta</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I radically changed the Shape's hierarchy. Now there are three big groups of Shapes: backgrounds, angulars and hands.</li>
			<li>A Shape can be placed only in one of the three lists contained by the clock: BackgroundShapes, AngularShapes, HandShapes.</li>
			<li>I added design time support for changing the Shapes of a clock.</li>
			<li>I created more Shapes and improves the old ones.</li>
			<li>I added more examples of the clock in the demo project.</li>
			<li>I added support for obtaining the time value internally if no ITimeProvider is configured.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>ver 2.0 alpha2</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Bug fix - In design time, the control was not initializing the default shapes. - Fixed</li>
			<li>I added some aditional explanations about how to use the control in the readme.txt file.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>ver 2.0 alpha</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The displayed time is now retrieved from an ITimeProvider instance.</li>
			<li>The UI is created like a puzzle using IShape objects.</li>
			<li>I created a lot of IShape objects that draws different types of graphic elements on the clock.</li>
			<li>I created a number of predefined shape sets that can be used programatically to easily change the aspect of the clock.</li>
		</ul>
		<div>Obs! In the future versions, the hierarchy of the IShape objects may change.</div>
		
		<h2>ver 1.0.0</h2>
