		<h1>IShape Implementations</h1>
		
		<p><span class="inline_code">ShapeBase</span> abstract class is the default implemnentation of the <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> interface. When creating a new Shape, it is recomanded to derive from this class or one of its descendents, rather then implementing the <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> members from scratch.</p>
		
		<p>
			Two other classes are extending the <span class="inline_code">ShapeBase</span> class:
			<ul>
				<li><span class="inline_code">VectorialShapeBase</span> - It is also an abstract class and offers support for drawing a vectorial image.</li>
				<li><span class="inline_code">ImageShape</span> - Draws an image on the clock.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>Before creating a new custom Shape class check the <a href="shapes_hierarchy.html">IShapes Hierarchy</a> to find the appropriete base class to extend.</p>
