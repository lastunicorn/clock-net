		<h1>ClockNet Explaind</h1>
		
		<p>When you use <strong>ClockNet</strong> there are three important things that you have to be aware of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Who updates the displayed value?</strong> - It can be done manually or by a timer. <a href="timer.html">See more...</a></li>
			<li><strong>What value is displayed?</strong> - Manually provided value, a value obtaqined from an <span class="inline_code">ITimeProvider</span> or an internal value. <a href="time_provider.html">See more...</a></li>
			<li><strong>How the clock looks?</strong> - You need to decorate the clock with Shapes (classes implementing the <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> interface). <a href="shapes_overview.html">See more...</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>The appearance - <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> interface</h3>
		
		<p>When it comes to the visual part, the clock is highly customizable.</p>
		
		<p>The hands, the numbers, the ticks that mark the seconds on the side of the clock, all are drawn by <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> objects and not directly by the clock. Therefore, if you want, you can replace the default <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> instances that handle the respecitive visual elements with some custom implementations that draws them as you need. For example you can replace the hands that, by default, are vectorial shapes, with some images. This is done with an <span class="inline_code">ImageHandShape</span> object (that also implements <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> interface). A demo project can be found in the release package. Check the "Clock Examples" form, tab "Fancy", first clock.
