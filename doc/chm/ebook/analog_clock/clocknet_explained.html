		<h1>ClockNet Explaind</h1>
		
		<p>When you use <strong>ClockNet</strong> there are three important things that you have to be aware of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Who updates the displayed value?</strong> - It can be done manually or by a timer. See more...</li>
			<li><strong>What value is displayed?</strong> - Manually provided value, a value obtaqined from an <span class="inline_code">ITimeProvider</span> or an internal value. See more...</li>
			<li><strong>How the clock looks?</strong> - You need to decorate the clock with Shapes (classes implementing the <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> interface). See more...</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>More detailed</h2>
		
		<h3>The action - <span class="inline_code">System.Windows.Forms.Timer</span> class</h3>
		<p>
			The <span class="inline_code">AnalogClock</span>'s value can be set in two ways:
			<ol>
				<li><strong>manually</strong> by specifying the <span class="inline_code">TimeSpan</span> value to be displayed. The value is static and it will not be changed until you specify a new one;</li>
				<li><strong>automatically</strong> by a <span class="inline_code">System.Windows.Forms.Timer</span> object that updates the displayed value periodically. The timer is using the <span class="inline_code">TimeSpan</span> value obtained from the <span class="inline_code">ITimeProvider</span> object. The timer will update the control with the value obtained from the time provider.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		
		<h3>The data - <span class="inline_code">ITimeProvider</span> interface</h3>
		<p>The sole purpose of the <span class="inline_code">ITimeProvider</span> interface is to provide a <span class="inline_code">TimeSpan</span> object when someone requests it.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="inline_code">AnalogClock</span> comes with three implementations of the <span class="inline_code">ITimeProvider</span> interface:
			<ul>
				<li><span class="inline_code">LocalTimeProvider</span> - Returns the system's local time.</li>
				<li><span class="inline_code">UtcTimeProvider</span> - Returns the UTC time.</li>
				<li><span class="inline_code">UtcOffsetTimeProvider</span> - Returns the UTC time to which an offset is added.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>The appearance - <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> interface</h3>
		
		<p>When it comes to the visual part, the clock is highly customizable.</p>
		
		<p>The hands, the numbers, the ticks that mark the seconds on the side of the clock, all are drawn by <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> objects and not directly by the clock. Therefore, if you want, you can replace the default <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> instances that handle the respecitive visual elements with some custom implementations that draws them as you need. For example you can replace the hands that, by default, are vectorial shapes, with some images. This is done with an <span class="inline_code">ImageHandShape</span> object (that also implements <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> interface). A demo project can be found in the release package. Check the "Clock Examples" form, tab "Fancy", first clock.
