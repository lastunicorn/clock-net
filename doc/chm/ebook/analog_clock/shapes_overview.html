		<p>All the AnalogClock GUI is created by Shapes that are displayed like the layers in Photoshop. The only graphical element that is not drawn by a Shape, is the background of the control.</p>
		<p>So, there is a Shape that draws the background of the dial, there are Shapes that draws the ticks and the numbers on the side of the dial, there are Shapes that draws the clock's hands and so on.</p>
