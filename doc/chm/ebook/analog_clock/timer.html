		<h1>The Timer</h1>
		
		<p>The time displayed by the AnalogClock control can be set manually or using a timer.</p>
		<p>
			To manually set the time, set the <span class="inline_code">Time</span> property of the AnalogClock control. By doing that, the clock will display the specified time indefinitely until you set the <span class="inline_code">Time</span> property with another value.
		</p>	
		<p>
			Another way to display a time in the AnalogClock control is by using a timer and a <span class="inline_code">ITimeProvider</span> object.
			The timer periodically updates the clock with a new value. But the value that is used comes from the <span class="inline_code">ITimeProvider</span> object.
		</p>
		<p>
			The timer that can be used is the <span class="inline_code">System.Windows.Forms.Timer</span> component that can be found in the "Components" category of the "ToolBox" window.
