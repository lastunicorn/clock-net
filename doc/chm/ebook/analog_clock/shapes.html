		<h1>The Shapes</h1>
		
		<p>A Shape is a class that draws a graphical element on the clock. To be a Shape a class must implements the <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> interface.</p>
				
		<p>The clock contains three types of shapes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Background Shapes</strong> - They draw the dial's background.</li>
			<li><strong>Angular Shapes</strong> - They are repeated at different angles around the clock, like the ticks and the numbers.</li>
			<li><strong>Hand Shapes</strong> - They draw the hands that display the time.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><span class="inline_code">ShapeBase</span> abstract class is the default implemnentation of the <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> interface. When creating a new Shape, it is recomanded to derive from this class or one of its descendents, rather then implementing the <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> members from scratch.</p>
