		<p>
			We can identify four types of Shapes on a clock:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Background Shapes</strong> - They draw the dial's background.</li>
				<li><strong>Angular Shapes</strong> - They are repeated at different angles around the clock, like the ticks and the numbers.</li>
				<li><strong>Hand Shapes</strong> - They draw the hands that display the time.</li>
			</ul>
