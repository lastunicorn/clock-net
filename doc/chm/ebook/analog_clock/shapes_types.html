		<h1>Types of Shapes</h1>
		
		<p>
			We can identify four types of Shapes on a clock:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Dial Shapes</strong> - They draw the dial's background. For example: <span class="inline_code">DialShape</span> and <span class="inline_code">TextShape</span> . The last one draws a text on the dial's background.</li>
				<li><strong>Angular Shapes</strong> - They are repeated at different angles around the clock, like the ticks (<span class="inline_code">Tick1Shape</span> and <span class="inline_code">Tick5Shape</span>) and the numbers (<span class="inline_code">NumbersShape</span>).</li>
				<li><strong>Hand Shapes</strong> - They draw the hands: <span class="inline_code">HourHandShape</span>, <span class="inline_code">MinuteHandShape</span>, <span class="inline_code">SweepHandShape</span>.</li>
				<li><strong>Top Shapes</strong> - Displayed on top of all other shapes. For example: <span class="inline_code">PinShape</span> that is drawing the pin that fixes the hands. It is the only one in this category right now, but in this category can apeare in the future shapes that will draw effects like glass reflections or some dirty glass cover.</li>
			</ul>
