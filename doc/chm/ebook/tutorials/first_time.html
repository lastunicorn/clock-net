		<h1>First Time</h1>
		
		<p>If it is the first time you use this control, here are some guidelines to make the first steps.</p>
		
		<h2>On short</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Add the "AnalogClock" control to the Toolbox.</li>
			<li>Drag a new "AnalogClock" control on your form.</li>
			<li>Attach a timer to the clock.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>With more details</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Add the "AnalogClock" control to the Toolbox.
				<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
					<li>Right click inside the Toolbox and choose "Add Tab" from the context menu. Name the newly created tab "Clock" (or any other name).</li>
					<li>Right click inside the "Clock" tab. Choose "Choose Items..." from the context menu.</li>
					<li>In the new dialog, on the ".Net Framework Components" click the "Browse..." button and open the "ClockNet.dll" file that you downloaded.</li>
				</ol>
				Now you should heve in the Toolbox's tab, the "AnalogClock" control.
			</li>
			<li>Drag from the Toolbox a new "AnalogClock" control on your form.</li>
			<li>Drag from the ToolBox on your form a new "Timer". It can be found in the "Components" tab. Set the Interval value and enable it from the "Properties" tool window.</li>
			<li>Select the "AnalogClock" added on your form. In the "Properties" tool window find the "Timer" property and set it to use the timer created in step 3.</li>
			<li>Additionally you may change the properties of the default shapes of the "AnalogClock" in "Properties" tool window in the "Shapes" category to make the clock look prettier.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Congratulations! You now have a working clock that displays the current system time.</p>

		<p>For advanced configurations, like changing the shapes with custom ones or using a different time provider, you need to write some code. (Hopefully some tutorials will be included in a later version. :D )</p>
