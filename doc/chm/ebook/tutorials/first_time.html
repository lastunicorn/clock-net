		<h1>First Time Using the AnalogClock</h1>
		
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		
		<p>To have a fully functional clock on your form you need to do two things: 1) drag the AnalogClock control from the Toolbox to your form and 2) attach a Timer to it. But if it is the first time to use the ClockNet, you need to add its controls to the Toolbox first. So there are three steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Add the ClockNet controls to the Toolbox.</li>
			<li>Drag a new AnalogClock control on your form.</li>
			<li>Attach a timer to the clock.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>If you already have the ClickNet controls in the Toolbox you can jump to directly Step2.</p>
		
		<h2>(Step 1) Add the ClockNet controls to the Toolbox.</h2>
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
			<li>Right click inside the Toolbox and choose "Add Tab" from the context menu. Name the newly created tab "ClockNet" (or any other name).</li>
			<li>Right click inside the "ClockNet" tab. Choose "Choose Items..." from the context menu.</li>
			<li>In the new dialog, on the ".Net Framework Components" click the "Browse..." button and open the "ClockNet.dll" file that you downloaded.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Now you should have in the Toolbox's tab, the ClockNet controls.</p>
		
		<h2>(Step 2) Drag a new "AnalogClock" control on your form.</h2>
		<p>This is simple: Drag from the Toolbox a new "AnalogClock" control and drop it on your form.</p>
		
		<h2>(Step 3) Attach a timer to the clock.</h2>
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
			<li>Drag from the ToolBox on your form a new "Timer". It can be found in the "Components" tab. Set the Interval value and enable it from the "Properties" tool window.</li>
			<li>Select the "AnalogClock" added on your form. In the "Properties" tool window find the "Timer" property and set it to use the timer created in step 3.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You now have a working clock that displays the current system time.</p>
