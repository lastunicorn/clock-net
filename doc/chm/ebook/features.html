		<p>This is the section where I should prise my control, isn't it?</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Decoupled design.</strong> The update is performed by the timer, the displayed value is provided by the Time Provider and the way the value is displayed is controlled by Shapes.</li>
			<li><strong>Customizable appearance.</strong> Using custom implementations of the <span class="inline_code">IShape</span> interface ClockNet can look as you like.</li>
			<li>The ability to <strong>display a custom time</strong> (not only the system's time) using a custom implementation of the <span class="inline_code">ITimeProvider</span>.</li>
			<li><strong>Scalable GUI.</strong> You can resize the clock from very small to very large. It will look the same.</li>
			<li><strong>Easy to use.</strong> Add a ClockNet control to your form and attach a timer. That's it. ;)</li>
