ClockNet
========

ver 2.0 beta
------------
I radically changed the Shape's hierarchy. Now there are three big groups of Shapes: backgrounds, angulars and hands.
A Shape can be placed only in one of the three lists contained by the clock: BackgroundShapes, AngularShapes, HandShapes.
I added design time support for changing the Shapes of a clock.
I created more Shapes and improves the old ones.
I added more examples of the clock in the demo project.
I added support for obtaining the time value internally if no ITimeProvider is configured.


ver 2.0 alpha2
--------------
Bug fix - In design time, the control was not initializing the default shapes. - Fixed
I added some aditional explanations about how to use the control in the readme.txt file.


ver 2.0 alpha
-------------
The displayed time is now retrieved from an ITimeProvider instance.
The UI is created like a puzzle using IShape objects.
I created a lot of IShape objects that draws different types of graphic elements on the clock.
I created a number of predefined shape sets that can be used programatically to easily change the aspect of the clock.

Obs! In the future versions, the hierarchy of the IShape objects may change.


ver 1.0.0
---------
First version. It was never released. This version was not very configurable and could not display numbers for hours.
